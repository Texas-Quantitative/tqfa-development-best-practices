# TQFA Best Practices Roadmap

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025  
**Current Version**: 2.1.1  

---

## 🎯 **Vision**

Transform web analysis from manual tool orchestration into **declarative, intent-based workflows** that enable developers to work at the level of "what they want to accomplish" rather than "which tools to run."

---

## 📊 **Version Strategy**

### **Current State: v2.1.1**
- ✅ Multi-breakpoint responsive analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive site analysis with element detection
- ✅ Smart caching (30-60x performance improvement)
- ✅ Class name preservation for recreation
- ✅ Express vs Detailed analysis modes (documented)

---

## 🚀 **Version 2.2.0 - Express vs Detailed Analysis** (Q4 2025)

### **Goal**: Two-tier analysis system for different use cases

### **Features**
- **Express Analysis** (3-5 minutes)
  - 7 standard breakpoints
  - Quick CSS extraction
  - Good for 80% of tasks
  - Default mode

- **Detailed Analysis** (8-15 minutes with time warning)
  - Discovers natural breakpoints
  - Per-breakpoint style extraction
  - Framework detection
  - JavaScript responsive behavior
  - Recommended mode for complex sites

### **Implementation Tasks**
- [ ] Create `intelligent-responsive-analyzer.mjs`
- [ ] Implement breakpoint discovery algorithm
- [ ] Add framework detection (Bootstrap, Tailwind, custom)
- [ ] Build per-breakpoint style extraction
- [ ] Add time warning system before detailed analysis
- [ ] Create upgrade path from express → detailed
- [ ] Implement complexity auto-detection and recommendations

### **CLI Interface**
```bash
npm run styles:express -- https://example.com     # Quick analysis
npm run styles:detailed -- https://example.com    # With time warning
npm run styles:auto -- https://example.com        # Auto-recommends mode
```

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Express mode completes in 3-5 minutes
- ✅ Detailed mode warns user of estimated time (8-15 min)
- ✅ Auto-detection recommends correct mode based on complexity
- ✅ Framework detection accurate for Bootstrap/Tailwind
- ✅ Natural breakpoint discovery within ±5px accuracy

## 🌟 **Version 3.0.0 - Declarative Site Extraction** (Q1 2026)

### **Goal**: Natural language interface for multi-viewport extraction and comparison

### **Features**

#### **Multi-Viewport Extraction**
```
"Extract exact page details for https://careington1.com at widths: 1400, 1000, 600"
```
- Capture complete analysis at each specified viewport
- Organized storage by domain and width
- Progressive extraction with status updates
- Time warnings for multi-viewport operations

#### **Framework-Specific Recreation**
```
"Build a replacement version of the page using HTML/Tailwind"
```
- Analyzes all extracted viewports
- Generates responsive code with proper breakpoint classes
- Preserves original class names
- Creates framework config files
- Minimal custom CSS required

#### **Site Comparison**
```
"Compare the scanned site to the local project site at 1000px width"
```
- Viewport-matched comparison
- Visual diff with side-by-side screenshots
- Accuracy scoring (layout, colors, typography, spacing)
- Actionable recommendations for fixing differences

### **Implementation Tasks**
- [ ] Create `declarative-analyzer.js` CLI tool
- [ ] Implement multi-viewport extraction engine
- [ ] Build organized storage structure (by domain/width)
- [ ] Create Tailwind code generator
- [ ] Create Bootstrap code generator
- [ ] Create vanilla CSS generator
- [ ] Implement responsive pattern detection
- [ ] Build comparison engine with visual diff
- [ ] Add accuracy scoring algorithm
- [ ] Generate actionable recommendations

### **Storage Structure**
```
project-root/
├── orig/
│   └── careington1.com/
│       ├── 1400px/
│       ├── 1000px/
│       └── 600px/
├── recreation/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── tailwind.config.js
│   └── comparison-report.md
```

### **Success Criteria**
- ✅ Multi-viewport extraction with time warnings
- ✅ Framework-specific code generation works
- ✅ Comparison accuracy >90% for recreation validation
- ✅ Visual diff clearly shows differences
- ✅ Recommendations are actionable and specific

---

## 🔮 **Version 3.1.0 - Interactive Analysis Mode** (Q2 2026)

### **Goal**: Interactive command-line interface for exploratory analysis

### **Features**
```bash
$ node tools/declarative-analyzer.js --interactive

> extract https://careington1.com at 1400, 1000, 600
Extracting at 3 viewports (~9 seconds)... [Progress bar]
Done!

> recreate using tailwind
Recreating... [Progress bar]
Files created in recreation/

> compare to localhost:8080 at 1000
Comparing... [Progress bar]
93% match. Show details? (y/n) y
[Detailed breakdown displayed]

> exit
```

### **Implementation Tasks**
- [ ] Build interactive REPL interface
- [ ] Add command history and auto-completion
- [ ] Implement progressive output during long operations
- [ ] Add contextual help system
- [ ] Create session management (save/load analysis sessions)

---

## 🌈 **Version 4.0.0 - AI-Enhanced Analysis** (Future)

### **Goal**: Intelligent analysis with AI-assisted optimization

### **Potential Features**
- Natural language query processing
- Accessibility optimization suggestions
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Component extraction and cataloging
- Design system generation from extracted sites
- Automated test generation for recreated pages

### **Examples**
```
"Extract careington1.com and optimize for accessibility"
→ Generates accessible version with ARIA labels, semantic HTML

"Compare my recreation and suggest performance improvements"
→ Analyzes bundle size, render blocking, optimization opportunities

"Extract the navigation pattern and add it to our component library"
→ Isolated component extraction with reusable code
```

## 🎓 **Lessons Learned - Guiding Principles**

### **1. Measure, Don't Guess**
The 64% height compression discovery came from measurement-based analysis, not assumptions.
→ **Roadmap Impact**: All tools should provide precise measurements

### **2. Cache Everything**
30-60x performance improvement from smart caching transformed developer experience.
→ **Roadmap Impact**: All new tools must include caching by default

### **3. Preserve Context**
Class name preservation prevents viewport adjustment confusion.
→ **Roadmap Impact**: Recreation tools must maintain original structure

### **4. Progressive Disclosure**
Express vs Detailed gives users choice based on needs and time constraints.
→ **Roadmap Impact**: New features should offer quick and thorough modes

### **5. Time Transparency**
Users need to know how long operations will take.
→ **Roadmap Impact**: All multi-step processes must warn users of time cost
