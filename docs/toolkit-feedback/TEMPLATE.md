## Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. [Tool Name] - Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

**Purpose**: [One sentence describing what this tool should do]

**Gap Identified**:
- Current Situation: [What the toolkit doesn't handle now]
- Impact: [How this affected the project - time wasted, accuracy issues, etc.]

**Use Case from This Project**:
```
[Specific example with details]
Example: "Spent 45 minutes manually inspecting mobile menu at 767px breakpoint:
- Had to click hamburger icon manually
- Inspected modal positioning (right: 0, width: 75%, max-width: 280px)
- Extracted animation properties one-by-one
- Captured SVG icon source manually"
```

**What the Tool Should Do**:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]
4. [etc.]

**Implementation Hints**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code or technical details
async function toolName(url, options) {
  // Key implementation details discovered during project
  // Selector patterns that work: [list]
  // Edge cases to handle: [list]
}
```

**Expected Output Format**:
```json
{
  "example": "What the JSON/report should look like",
  "sections": [
    "Section 1: [Description]",
    "Section 2: [Description]"
  ]
}
```

**Proposed npm Script**:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "analyze:tool-name": "node src/analyzers/tool-name.mjs"
  }
}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- [Benefit 1]
- [Benefit 2]
- [Benefit 3]

### 2. [Second Tool Name] - Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

[Repeat structure above for each recommended tool]

---

## Toolkit Accuracy Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: [Description]

**What Toolkit Reported**: [Incorrect or incomplete output]

**Actual Reality**: [What manual inspection revealed]

**How We Discovered**: [Process that revealed the gap]

**Impact**: [How this affected recreation accuracy]

**Suggested Fix**: [How toolkit should be improved]

---

## Manual Scripts Created

List custom scripts created during this project that could be generalized into toolkit features:

### Script 1: `[filename.js]`
- **Purpose**: [What it does]
- **Why Created**: [Toolkit gap it filled]
- **Lines of Code**: [Approximate size]
- **Reusability**: [Could this be generalized?]
- **Location**: [Path to script in project]

---

## Iterative Refinement Pain Points

Document repetitive manual adjustments that took excessive time:

### Element/Section: [Name]
**Property Being Adjusted**: [e.g., "Section height"]  
**Iterations Required**: [Number]  
**Values Tried**: [List of values - e.g., 540px → 510px → 460px → 470px → 450px]  
**Time Spent**: [Approximate time]  
**Why Difficult**: [What made this tedious]  
**Potential Tool Solution**: [How a tool could help]

---

## Unexpected Discoveries

Document things the toolkit completely missed or reported incorrectly:

### Discovery 1: [Title]
**What We Expected**: [Based on toolkit output]  
**What We Found**: [Actual reality]  
**How Discovered**: [Manual inspection method]  
**Example**:
```
Expected: font-family: Montserrat; font-weight: 500
Reality: font-family: MontserratMedium (weight baked into font file)
Impact: Had to download actual font files and inspect @font-face declarations
```

---

## Documentation Gaps

Sections that should be added to toolkit documentation:

### Suggested New Guide: `docs/guides/[filename.md]`
**Title**: [Guide title]  
**Topics to Cover**:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

**Why Needed**: [What current documentation doesn't cover]

---

## Time Analysis

**Breakdown of Time Spent**:
- Setup/Installation: [X minutes]
- Running Toolkit Tools: [X minutes]
- Manual Analysis (gaps in toolkit): [X hours] ⚠️
- Custom Script Creation: [X hours] ⚠️
- Iterative Refinement: [X hours] ⚠️
- Implementation/Recreation: [X hours]

**Total Manual Work Due to Toolkit Gaps**: [X hours]  
**Percentage of Time Wasted on Workarounds**: [X%]

---

## Recommended Implementation Priority

Based on this project's experience:

**IMMEDIATE (Next Release)**:
1. [Tool name] - [Reason: time savings/common use case/accuracy]

**SOON (v2.x)**:
2. [Tool name] - [Reason]
3. [Tool name] - [Reason]

**FUTURE (v3.x+)**:
4. [Tool name] - [Reason]
5. [Tool name] - [Reason]
